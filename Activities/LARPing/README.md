# Live Action Role Playing
Live Action Role Playing (or LARP) is an activity where campers get to use foam weaponry to battle it out in the field of combat. It's one of the most high energy and fun activities of the week.

## Rules

### 1) Safety First
The number one rule is safety. Every camper, and counselor, will always be moving at a safe speed where they are in full control.

### 2) Listen to the Battlemasters
If Battlemaster Devin, Battlemaster Vishesh or Battlemaster Booth give a command, please follow it. If Supreme Battle Overlord Megan or Supreme Battle Overlord Sarah give a command, please follow those as well. If you hear a Battlemaster yell "STOP", stop all combat and repeat back to us "STOP".

- Practice this at least once

### 3) Hit Locations
For melee weapons, valid hit locations are the Torso, Arms, Hands and Legs. Head, directly below the belt and feet are off limits. If we see you hitting any off limits area with a melee weapon a battle master will give you a warning. If you get a second warning, a Battlemaster may ask you to sit out of combat until at least the next round, maybe longer. 

#### Torso
If you are hit in the Torso you are slain. Drop all your weapons, make your best deathcry, and fall to the ground or stop your wheelchair. After a moment you may slowly, holding your weapon in both hands in a non-threatening manner, move to the edge of the battlefield if you wish.

#### Arms
If you are hit in the arm, that results in the loss of that arm. You must immediately drop everything you were holding with your hand and place your arm behind your back if you can, or put it down on your armrest.

#### Hands
If you are hit in the hand, it is treated as if you were hit in the arm. However, if that hand is holding a weapon or shield, then you hand is treated as part of that weapon and is unaffected.

#### Legs
If you are hit in the leg, that results in the loss of that leg. You may no longer walk on that leg or turn in that direction if you are in a power chair. You may either hop or crawl on your knees.

If you lose 2 limbs, so either both legs, both arms, or a leg and an arm, you are slain. 

### 4) Shields and Mage Staffs
Shields and Mage staves can only be use for defense. Do not push or hit another combatant with a shield or mage staff. If we see you using a mage staff or shield for offense, we will give you a warning.

### 5) Valid Weapons
All weapons must past inspection by Battlemaster Booth before being able to be used in combat. If your weapon doesn't pass Booth's inspection, you will be asked to use a substitute weapon for combat.

### 6) Spells (for when they are introduced)
These dodgeballs are spells. Spell casters may block attacks with their spells. If you are hit in the torso, you may choose a limb to lose. Being hit in the head with a ranged weapon counts as a torso hit, but please do not purposely aim for the head. If we believe you are purposely aiming for the head, we will give you a warning.

### 7) Healers (for when they are introduced)
Healers can use Mage Staffs and magical poems. In order to heal someone, the healer must recite the entire poem from start to finish. Once they complete the poem, they may pick 3 combatants within armâ€™s reach to heal. When healed you regain the use of a limb that you had lost in combat before. Healing cannot bring back a combatant who has been slain.
