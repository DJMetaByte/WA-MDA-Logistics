# Game Modes
There are several game modes we can play at MDA camp, which ones and how many may vary from year to year.

## Wild Animal Hunt
We begin the wargames at the dawn of civilization. Campers, you are hunters looking to find wild game for your village tonight. Counselors, you are un-armed wild animals roaming the wilderness. The game ends when all the animals have been slain and the campers have enough food for their village.

CAMPERS CAN I HEAR YOU BATTLE CRIES? <br>
COUNSELORS... CAN I HEAR YOUR MONSTEROUS ROARS? <br>
BEGIN.

## Free for All
The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass. And with it, the wilderness has become more dangerous. Counselors, you are now bandits are able to arm yourselves. In this next battle there are no alliances, take no prisoners and trust no one. This battle is a Free for All Fray where only the last one standing wins. 

COMBATANTS CAN I HEAR YOUR BATTLE CRIES? <br>
You have 30 seconds to get into position! <br>
3 2 1 BEGIN

## Cabin Contest
The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass. And with it civilization has advanced. Now people have begun to gather into groups, and work together as a team. Some grudges from the free for all have been forgotten, and yesterday’s enemies are todays allies. But some hostility remains, and our camp is split into 2 competing sides. 

Cabin A - Cabin B - Cabin C - Cabin D - You are the Red Team <br>
Cabin E - Cabin F - Cabin G - Cabin H - You are the Blue Team

After your village rivalry comes to a head, it's time to see which side will come out on time. I need each team to come up with a team name and get everyone a penny that matches their team color. (After they are ready with their pennies)

TEAM A - CAN I HEAR YOUR BATTLE CRIES? <br>
TEAM B - CAN I HEAR YOUR BATTLE CRIES?
BEGIN

## Royal Rivalry
The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass. Team A and Team B once battled over this land. And while Team <winner> won the battle, they did not win the war. Now, these teams have grown into kingdoms, and you must decide who among you will ascend to the throne. Kingdom of A, Kingdom of B, please designate royalty which you must protect. 

The royals are not trained in combat and will not sink so low as to wield a weapon of their own. But, they have the power to fully heal a nearby combatant with a simple royal wave of their hand. After a combatant has been healed or revived twice, they cannot be revived again. Once a team’s monarch is slain, that team loses.

KINGDOM OF A CAN I HEAR YOUR BATTLE CRIES <br>
KINGDOM OF B CAN I HEAR YOUR BATTLE CRIES <br>

## Flag Face-Off
The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass. After eons of battle, the empire of <A> and <B> have decided to have one last battle to determine which empire will rule in the final age. Each empire has a flag that represents their might, and must defend it with all their strength. If an enemy CAMPER takes your empires flag and brings it back to their stronghold they win. Counselors are not allowed to capture the flag.

EMPIRE OF B CAN I HEAR YOUR BATTLE CRIES <br>
