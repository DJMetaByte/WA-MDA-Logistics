# Live Action Role Playing
Live Action Role Playing (or LARP) is an activity where campers get to use foam weaponry to battle it out in the field of combat. It's one of the most high energy and fun activities of the week.

## Game Modes

[Free for All](modes.md/#free-for-all): Free for all where it's every combatant for themselves

[Cabin Contest](modes.md/#cabin-contest): 2 teams of cabins facing off against eachother

[Royal Rivalry](modes.md/#royal-rivalry): The teams now have a monarch they must protect

[Age of Magic](modes.md/#age-of-magic): The teams now have magical powers

[Flag Face-Off](modes.md/#flag-face-off): The teams now have a flag they must protect

## Rules

### 1) Safety First
The number one rule is safety. Every camper, and counselor, will always be moving at a safe speed where they are in full control.

### 2) Listen to the Battlemasters
If Battlemaster Devin or Battlemaster Booth give a command, please follow it. If Supreme Battle Overlord Megan or Supreme Battle Overlord Kearstin give a command, please follow those as well. If we think you're purposefully breaking any rules a Battlemaster will ask you to sit out. If you hear a Battlemaster yell "STOP", stop all combat and repeat back to us "STOP".

- Practice this x3 times

### 3) Hit Locations
Walid hit locations are the Torso, Arms, Hands and Legs. Head, directly below the belt and feet are off limits. If we see you hitting any off limits area with a melee weapon a battle master will give you a warning. If you get a second warning, a Battlemaster may ask you to sit out of combat until at least the next round, maybe longer. 

#### Torso
If you are hit in the Torso you are slain. Drop all your weapons, make your best deathcry, and fall to the ground or stop your wheelchair. After a moment you may slowly, holding your weapon in both hands in a non-threatening manner, move to the edge of the battlefield if you wish.

#### Arms
If you are hit in the arm, that results in the loss of that arm. You must immediately drop everything you were holding with your hand and place your arm behind your back if you can, or put it down on your armrest.

#### Hands
If you are hit in the hand, it is treated as if you were hit in the arm. However, if that hand is holding a weapon or shield, then you hand is treated as part of that weapon and is unaffected.

#### Legs
If you are hit in the leg, that results in the loss of that leg. You may no longer walk on that leg or turn in that direction if you are in a power chair. You may either hop or crawl on your knees.

If you lose 2 limbs, so either both legs, both arms, or a leg and an arm, you are slain. 

### 4) Shields
Shields can only be use for defense. Do not push or hit another combatant with a shield. If we see you trying to use a shield for offense, we will give you a warning.

### 5) Valid Weapons
All weapons must past inspection by Battlemaster Booth before being able to be used in combat. If your weapon doesn't pass Booth's inspection, you will be asked to use a substitute weapon for combat.

### 6) Summoners
Campers, if you want to participate but you do not wish to use a weapon directly you may choose to be a summoner. Summoners may designate a counselor from their cabin to be their summoned minion to do combat in their stead. If you are a summoner, you are immune to attacks, however if your summoned minion is slain, you can no longer fight. Minons must be within 2 to 3 steps of their summoners at all times and must listen to combat related orders of their summoner during battle.

If you want, you may opt to be a healer. Healers can use staffs and mystical poems, but not weapons are sheilds. In order to use their powers, a healer must recite the entire poem from start to finish. Once they complete the poem, they may pick 3 combatants within arm’s reach to heal. When healed you regain the use of a limb that you had lost in combat before. Healing cannot bring back a combatant who has been slain.

- Note for us: We might ask campers early in the week to make some mystical poems. Poems must be at least 60 syllables long.
